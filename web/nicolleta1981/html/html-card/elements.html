  <body>
    <h2> HTML elements are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind easily</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Main root</li>
      <p><html>	The HTML < html > element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.</p>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Document metadata</li>
      <p>Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information. </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>< base ></b>	The HTML < base > element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document.</li>
  <li><b>< head >< / head ></b>The HTML < head > element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.</li>
  <li><b>< link ></b>The HTML External Resource Link element < link > specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. 
    <p>This element is most commonly used to link to CSS, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.</p></li>
  <li><b>< meta ></b>The HTML < meta > element represents Metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like base, link, script, style or title.</li>
  <li><b> style </b>The HTML style  element contains style information for a document, or part of a document.</li>
  <li><b>< title ></b>The HTML Title element (< title >) defines the document's title that is shown in a Browser's title bar or a page's tab.</li>
</ol>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Sectioning root</li>
      <p><b>< body ></b>The HTML < body > Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one < body > element in a document.</p>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Content sectioning</li>
      <p>Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content. </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>< address ></b>The HTML < address > element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.</li>
        <li><b>< article ></b>The HTML < article > element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).</li>
        <li><b>< aside ></b>The HTML < aside > element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.</li>
        <li><b>< footer ></b>The HTML < footer > element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A < footer > typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.</li>
        <li><b>< header ></b>The HTML < header > element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</li>
        <li><b>< h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, < h4 >, < h5 >, < h6 ></b>The HTML < h1 >–< h6 > elements represent six levels of section headings. < h1 > is the highest section level and < h6 > is the lowest.</li>
        <li><b>< main ></b>The HTML < main > element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</li>
        <li><b>< nav ></b>he HTML < nav > element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.</li>
        <li><b>< section ></b>The HTML < section > element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.</li>
      </ol>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Text content</li>
      <p>Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening < body > and closing </ body > tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content. </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>< blockquote ></b>The HTML < blockquote > Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). 
          <p>A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the cite element.</p></li>
        <li><b>< dd ></b>The HTML < dd > element provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (dt) in a description list (dl).</li>
        <li><b>< div ></b>The HTML Content Division element < div > is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).</li>
        <li><b>< dl ></b>The HTML < dl > element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the dt element) and descriptions (provided by dd elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).</li>
        <li><b>< dt ></b>The HTML < dt > element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a dl element.</li>
        <li><b>< figcaption ></b>The HTML < figcaption > or Figure Caption element represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent figure element.</li>
        <li><b>< figure ></b>The HTML < figure > (Figure With Optional Caption) element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the figcaption element.</li>
        <li><b>< hr ></b>The HTML < hr > element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.</li>
        <li><b>< li ></b>The HTML < li > element is used to represent an item in a list.</li>
        <li><b>< ol ></b>The HTML < ol > element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.</li>

      </ol>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Inline text semantics</li>

<ol>
  <li><b>< a ></b>The HTML < a > element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</li>
  <li><b>< abbr ></b>The HTML Abbreviation element < abbr > represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation.</li>
  <li><b>< b ></b>The HTML Bring Attention To element < b > is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.</li>
  <li><b>< bdi ></b>The HTML Bidirectional Isolate element < bdi >  tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text.</li>
  <li><b>< bdo ></b>The HTML Bidirectional Text Override element < bdo > overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.</li>
  <li><b>< br ></b>The HTML < br > element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.</li>
  <li><b>< cite ></b>The HTML Citation element < cite > is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work.</li>
  <li><b>< code ></b>The HTML < code > element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code.</li>
  <li><b>< data ></b>The HTML < data > element links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the time element must be used.</li>
  <li><b>< dfn ></b>The HTML Definition element < dfn > is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence.</li>
  <li><b>< em ></b>The HTML < em > element marks text that has stress emphasis. The < em > element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.</li>

  <li><b>< rp ></b>The HTML Ruby Fallback Parenthesis < rp > element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the ruby element.</li>
  <li><b>< rt ></b>The HTML Ruby Text < rt > element specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The < rt > element must always be contained within a ruby element.</li>
  <li><b>< rtc ></b>The HTML Ruby Text Container < rtc > element embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of rb elements used inside of ruby element. rb elements can have both pronunciation (rt) and semantic (rtc) annotations.</li>
  <li><b>< ruby ></b>The HTML < ruby > element represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.</li>
  <li><b>< s ></b>The HTML < s > element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the < s > element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, < s > is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the del and ins elements, as appropriate.</li>

  <li><b>< small ></b>The HTML < small > element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from small to x-small.</li>
  <li><b>< span ></b>The HTML < span > element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.</li>
  <li><b>< strong ></b>The HTML Strong Importance Element < strong > indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</li>

  <li><b>< wbr ></b>The HTML < wbr > element represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.</li>
</ol>

  <li><b>< source ></b>The HTML < source > element specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element.</li>
</ol>
      <li style="color:red; font-size:25px">SVG and MathML</li>
<p>You can embed SVG and MathML content directly into HTML documents, using the < svg > and < math > elements.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>< svg ></b>The svg element is a container that defines a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document.</li>
  <li><b>< math ></b>The top-level element in MathML is < math >. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in < math > tags. In addition you must not nest a second < math > element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it.</li>
</ol>
<li style="color:red; font-size:25px">Scripting</li>
<p>In order to create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>< canvas ></b>Use the HTML < canvas > element with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.</li>
