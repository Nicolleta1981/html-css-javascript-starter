# Step by Step instructions

Hi and welcome to **My CV v3 starter**. The v3 is a complete rewrite and total makeover of all the processes envolved in creating and delivering this project.

## Write down the plan

### Rules to follow (guidance, call it however you want, just do it)

1. You want to create all the issues ahead of writing your first piece of code.
1. You **MUST NOT** write it as a copy/paste, it doesn't help you at the full potential.
1. Create a pull request for all main issues.
1. Use all the time `yarn c` or `npm run c` for every single commit you make.
1. Add a description with all the sub-issues present in a main issue and have their status unchecked. Make sure the issue numbers are updated to the correct ones.
    * Example:
```
* [ ] feat: create section title for connect #9 
* [ ] feat: add image with rounder corners and border #10
* [ ] feat: add list of icons and link to social media #11
* [ ] feat: add continue indicator #12
```

1. Make use of https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/synonym to find alternatives to the words I have used if you don't have a good enough vocabulary to make use of it. Working on developing your creativity will help you land a job faster, so don't skip it, as you skip also the opportunity to become the best version of yourself.
    * Example: update 
    
      `feat: marianzburlea - create welcome section` 
      
      to 
      
      `feat: yourgithubusername - create the landing page section`
